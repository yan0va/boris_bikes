#Boris Bikes

##Makers Academy Week 3 Project

###Aim

The aim of this project was to act as an introduction to Object-Oriented Programming. We had to build a simple system for managing Boris Bikes in London.


###Features

Our system can keep track of a number of docking stations and the bikes. It allows you to rent the bikes and return them. Occasionally the bikes can break and then they will be unavailable for rental. There is also a garage to fix the bikes and a van to move the bikes between the stations and garage.

* A person can rent a bike from a docking station
* A person can ride a bike (accidentally break a bike)
* A person can return a bike to a docking station
* A station has hold bikes (up to a certain capacity)
* A station only allows working bikes to be rented
* A station releases broken bikes to a van
* A van delivers broken bikes to a garage
* A garage fixes broken bikes
* A van collects fixed bikes from the garage and returns them to docking stations
